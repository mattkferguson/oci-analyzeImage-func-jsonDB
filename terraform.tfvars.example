# true  => Use private endpoint in the private subnet (recommended for production)
# false => Use public endpoint (open access; suitable for quick demos)
# NOTE: Switching this from false -> true forces creation of a NEW Autonomous Database
#       and destruction of the old one (data is not preserved). See README for details.
